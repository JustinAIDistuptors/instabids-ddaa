## USAGE GUIDELINES

### When to Create Summaries
- After reading conversation files
- After analyzing domain-specific documentation
- After examining key project documents

### Summary Format
Each summary should include:
- **Source:** Reference to the original file(s)
- **Last Updated:** Timestamp
- **Key Points:** Bullet-point list of important information
- **Connections:** How this relates to other parts of the system
- **Implications:** What this means for implementation

### Updating Summaries
- Summaries should be updated when new information is discovered
- Original content should be preserved with new insights added
- Conflicting information should be noted with the most recent understanding taking precedence

## INITIAL SUMMARIES NEEDED

The first summaries to be created are:
1. Conversation summaries from ConversationPart1.txt through ConversationPart4.txt
2. Core domain summaries for User Management, Project Management, and Bidding
3. Document summaries for key architectural files
