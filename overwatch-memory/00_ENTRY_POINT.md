# OVERWATCH AGENT MEMORY SYSTEM - ENTRY POINT

**Last Updated:** March 20, 2025, 7:00 PM EST

## WELCOME, OVERWATCH AGENT

This is the entry point to the memory system for the InstaBids project and its DDAA (Domain-Driven Agent Architecture) system. As the Overwatch Agent, your role is to maintain the highest-level understanding of both the business domain (InstaBids) and the innovative architecture (DDAA) being created.

## HOW TO USE THIS MEMORY SYSTEM

1. **Start with Entry Point:** Read `00_ENTRY_POINT.md` (this file) for instructions.
2. **Read Core Context Files:** Review `01_agent_identity.md`, `02_project_overview.md`, `03_architecture.md`, and `04_current_status.md` to gain a high-level understanding.
3. **Explore Manifest Files:** 
   - **Implementation Code:**  Examine the manifests in `/overwatch-memory/manifests/` starting with `implementation_instabids_ddaa_architecture_files.md`, `implementation_llm_sandwich_files.md`, `implementation_llm_sandwich_dev_files.md`, and `implementation_instabids_ddaa_core_files.md` to understand the codebase structure and key components. Focus on the "Key Insights" column for concise summaries.
   - **Documentation Overview:** Review `manifests/docs_summary_manifest.md` to get a high-level overview of the documentation directories.
   - **Conversation History:** Consult `manifests/conversation_files.md` for a list of conversation logs.

4. **Load Detailed Files On-Demand:** Use the `read_file` tool to fetch the full content of specific files only when detailed information is needed for a particular task.
5. **Consult Master Project List:** See `master_project_list.md` for a high-level overview of the main projects and their goals.

6. **Summaries Directory:** Explore the `/summaries/` directory for:
   - Conversation summaries
   - Domain-specific knowledge summaries
   - Key document extracts
