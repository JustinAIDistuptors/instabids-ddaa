# IMPLEMENTATION FILES MANIFEST enter. It is literally working five hours of books together and I'm going to show you now is exactly what it did. It was for hours. You haven't worked. I would find what needs every other day out there and show you what you can do when you get your bills. Really cool stuff. And at the end, you get to the very end. We'll see if it actually feel definitely our application and see what actually came up with those grounds. I haven't seen what it did. I keep the task. I let it run for hours. Now we're gonna look at the results. What it did is gonna be a surprise to me. This might just get me in there. We're gonna see. I've been here a lot. I use data now. We're gonna see how we're seeing people as photographed in all your application. I show you the problem a 2nd ago, which is really cool. Give it multiple. That's why I have to give a couple reading. Obviously. So I'm really interested. Like AI programming. I think it's like the next big thing. So I also have to go on. I have another only working people. The game disappointed as well.- LLM SANDWICH
