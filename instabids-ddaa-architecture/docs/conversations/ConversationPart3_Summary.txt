Summary of ConversationPart3.txt:

This part of the conversation addresses questions about applying the DDAA architecture to specific domains, initial implementation steps, and the user's desire to incorporate domain-specific AI agents.

Key points discussed:

*   **Applying DDAA to Domains:**  User asks for elaboration on how to apply the DDAA architecture to specific domains within InstaBids.
*   **First Implementation Steps:** User inquires about the initial steps to start building with the DDAA architecture.
*   **Prioritizing Domains:** User asks about how to prioritize which domains to implement first.
*   **Domain-Specific AI Agents:** User introduces the idea of having each domain sandwich run by its own "true AI Agent" (separate LLM instance), suggesting this could be a further layer of innovation.
*   **Benefits of Domain-Specific LLMs:** User speculates that domain-specific LLMs could lead to easier and more consistent learning, prompting, and pattern thinking within each domain.
*   **Request for Assessment:** User asks for an assessment of the domain-specific AI agent concept, including potential benefits, drawbacks, and whether it represents a significant architectural improvement.

This part of the conversation shifts towards more concrete implementation planning and explores the advanced concept of domain-specific AI agents, setting the stage for a potentially more distributed and specialized architecture.
